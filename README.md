# AutoSpare Inventory System (C++)

A simple inventory management system built in C++ for a typical automobile spare parts shop.  
It manages product sales, customer data, loyalty points, and profit tracking through a command-line interface.

---

## Project Objective

To build a basic system that:
- Stores and displays inventory items
- Handles item sales and stock reduction
- Maintains customer details and spending
- Awards loyalty points (especially for mechanics)
- Calculates daily/overall profit

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++ (compiled using G++)
- **Data Handling**: CSV files (read/write)
- **Interface**: CLI-based menu system
- **Environment**: VS Code + g++ (Windows)

---

## Tools Used

- g++ compiler  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Microsoft Excel (for occasional CSV edits)  
- Git & GitHub (version control)

---

## What I Learned

- Object-oriented design in C++ using classes and arrays
- File I/O with `fstream` for persistent data storage
- Handling `cin`, `getline()`, `cin.ignore()` without input bugs
- Error handling with `stoi()` / `stof()` and `try-catch`
- Simulating real-world business logic in code
- Debugging input loops and logic branches patiently

---

## Challenges Faced

- CSV parsing kept failing due to blank lines or malformed data  
- Accidentally iterated the wrong way while validating product IDs  
- Mixing `cin` with `getline()` caused unexpected bugs  
- `stoi()` and `stof()` threw exceptions on bad CSV rows  
- Keeping customer type logic and loyalty point calculations consistent

---

## Future Scope

- Add password-protected admin login  
- Product search by ID or name  
- Switch to JSON or SQLite for better data handling  
- GUI (maybe Qt or Python with C++ backend)  
- Monthly/weekly profit report generation
